### About Docker Versions  

Find out all that you need to know about the docker Tags, and the version of **ewsdocker/debian-nodejs** represented, at [Docker Tags](https://github.com/ewsdocker/debian-nodejs/wiki/DockerTags).  
_____________________  

**docker pull** will pull the **latest** image by default.  This image is based on the GitHub **master** source, which is the development version, and quite possibly **unstable**.  

The **stable** version is the most stable version of the most recent **Debian** version.  It may (most likely) not be the newest GitHub version.  

NOTE: If the _New Version_ version number is not in the **Tags**, the **latest** tag is still under test.  Testing will be complete when the _New Version_ tag exists.

Other Docker versions (or tags) can be selected on the Docker [Tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/ewsdocker/debian-nodejs/tags/) page.  

An explanation of the [Docker Tags](https://github.com/ewsdocker/debian-nodejs/wiki/DockerTags) is available on the [ewsdocker/debian-nodejs Wiki](https://github.com/ewsdocker/debian-nodejs/wiki).
